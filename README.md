## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashleigh-hopkins/audi-connect-dev.git
cd audi-connect-dev
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Clone the Audi Connect HA library

The `audi_connect_ha` library is a Home Assistant custom component, not a pip package. Clone it into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/audiconnect/audi_connect_ha.git
```

## Configuration

### Using config.json (Recommended)

Create a `config.json` file based on the provided example:

```bash
cp config_example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your credentials:

```json
{
  "username": "your.email@example.com",
  "password": "your_password",
  "country": "DE",
  "spin": "1234",
  "api_level": 0,
  "vehicles": [
    {
      "vin": "WAUZZZ...",
      "name": "My Audi",
      "model": "Audi e-tron",
      "model_year": "2024",
      "csid": "optional_csid",
      "notes": "Main family vehicle"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Configuration parameters:**
- `username`: Your Audi Connect account email
- `password`: Your Audi Connect account password
- `country`: Your country code (DE, US, CA, or CN)
- `spin`: Your 4-digit S-PIN for security operations
- `api_level`: API level (0 for gas vehicles, 1 for e-tron/electric)
- `vehicles`: Optional array of vehicle configurations

### Using command-line arguments

Alternatively, you can provide credentials via command line:

```bash
python audi_cli.py -u your.email@example.com -p your_password -c DE --spin 1234
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit credentials**: Always use `config.json` (which is gitignored) or environment variables
- **S-PIN Security**: Your S-PIN is required for security-critical operations like lock/unlock
- **Token Storage**: Authentication tokens are stored temporarily in memory only
- **Rate Limiting**: The CLI includes built-in throttling protection to prevent account suspension

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify your credentials are correct
   - Check if your account is active on myAudi website
   - Ensure you're using the correct country code

2. **Missing vehicle data**
   - Some features may not be available for all vehicles
   - Check API level (0 for gas, 1 for electric vehicles)
   - Ensure vehicle has active Audi Connect subscription

3. **Rate limiting errors**
   - Wait at least 15 minutes between requests
   - Use the built-in throttling protection
   - Avoid excessive API calls

4. **SSL/Certificate errors**
   - Update your Python certificates: `pip install --upgrade certifi`
   - Check your system time is correct
